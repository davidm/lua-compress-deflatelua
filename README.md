Description
-----------

`compress.deflatelua` is a library implementing [DEFLATE], as well as
[zlib] and [gzip] decompression in pure [Lua].

Example usage
-------------

    ./gunziplua lua-5.1.4.tar.gz

Performance
-----------

It's somewhat slow (as expected).  To decompress `lua-5.1.4.tar.gz`, it
takes about 9 seconds with CRC-checking enabled (4 with LuaJIT 1.x) or
3 seconds with CRC checking disabled (2 with LuaJIT 1.x).

Rationale
---------

Possible reasons for this module include:

1. for pedagogical reasons
2. to benchmark Lua
3. to bootstrap applications like LuaRocks/LuaDist
   that might not have a precompiled copy of gunzip, and
4. because [DEFLATE] has been implemented in other languages too,
   including Python, Perl, and Lisp.

Status
------

It should be robust and there are no known bugs. It successfully
decompresses gzip files but there is currently no compressor implementation.

Dependencies
------------

* [digest.crc32lua] - CRC-32 checksum implemented in pure Lua
* [bit.numberlua] - bitwise operations implemented in pure Lua as numbers
  (not required if using a native bitwise operation library)
* [pythonic.optparse] - command-line processing resembling the Python
  optparse module

Conventions
-----------

The modules above follow a somewhat Perl CPAN-like naming convention.
Compare to [`Compress::Zlib::Perl`], [`Digest::CRC32`] and the `Bit::`
modules.
